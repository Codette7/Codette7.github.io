                <h3>Who is Codette?</h3>
        <p><div class="text-block">Hello, world! I'm a former bartender, current actor, and aspiring programmer. When COVID derailed both my bartending and acting plans for 2020, I decided to get back into something I hadn't done for a long time - coding! Back in the day, I used to mess around with HTML and CSS on MySpace. I had a whole site where I made custom page layouts and graphics for people. It's been a while, but I'm excited to re-start my journey, and you have you along for the ride!</p><br></div>
            <h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
        <h6>12/02/2020</h6>
                <h3>Where will programming take me?</h3>
        <p><div class="text-block">My ultimate goal is to work as a computer programmer. I really enjoyed restaurant/bar work, but health insurance and a 401k are sounding really nice right about now. I want to work on important projects and make websites from the ground up. </p><br></div>
            <h2 id="current">Current Progress</h2>
        <h6>12/02/2020</h6>
                <h3>Where am I now?</h3>
        <p><div class="text-block">I'm currently learning coding on Khan Academy. I tried CS50 and freecodecamp, but Khan broke things down into the tiniest baby steps and really helped me wrap my head around things and get into the programming mindset. So far I completed the Intro to JavaScript course, and am breezing through the HTML/CSS Intro course. I'm planning to do the SQL course next, and maybe more back-end languages after that.</p></div>
